# Space-time around Schwartzschild Black Holes

This project was conducted with Cl√©ment Pellouin and Augustin Tommasini under the supervision of Prof. F. Daigne between January and March 2019. The goal is to simulate the movement of massive and massless particles near a Schwartzschild black hole, as well as the apparent sky for a freely falling observer into the singularity.
